    <h3>Analysis from last race - <b>2024 Singapore Grand Prix</b> (Sept 22, 2024)</h3>
    <p>
        I believe that this race was absolutely brilliant for McLaren. 
        McLaren is my favorite team so I may sound a little bias but honestly they couldn’t have done a better race, besides a McLaren 1-2. 
        It seems like to a non-F1 fan, this may not make any sense at all, but I will do my best to explain the concept of this race. 
        This season of F1 has been sort of an underdog story. McLaren last season was LAST in the championship battle with all the other teams. 
        This year has been a complete 180 and they have been killing it. If you don’t already know, they are FIRST this season as of this Singapore GP. 
        This truly is remarkable and it commends McLaren’s engineering team. To be able to learn from their mistakes and keep pushing is incredible to 
        witness in real time. <br> <br>I only hope that McLaren continues to flourish and even though they have had their ups and downs this year, they 
        continue to fight hard. This race solidified their lead in the constructers (team) championship battle and hopefully this will also allow 
        the individual world championship battle to come to fruition. I believe in Lando Norris to become world champion and fingers crosses we get 
        to witness that this season! Let’s go <a href="https://www.mclaren.com/racing/formula-1/2018/car-launch/mclaren-and-papaya-2174925/">TEAM PAPAYA!!</a>
